            <p id="p1">When I was around 10 years old, my sister and I were addicted to Donkey Kong on Nintendo 64. We played that game religiously, but we could never beat this one boss that was in like an arena surrounded by lava. One day, my parents had this party and some of their friends brought their kids. One of those kids was our saviour and beat the boss somehow, I couldnt tell you how, I am pretty sure he knew black magic. Anyways, the boss was beat and we could finally progress in the game, that was until my brother decided to delete all saved games... To this day I still could not tell you how to defeat the lava boss, or who the master wizard was that beat it for us. </p>

            <p id="p2">Now I'll tell you about the boring parts of my life. I grew up in Allen, Texas. Home of the Allen Eagles and the overpriced stadium, but hey everythings bigger in Texas (especially the highschool bands.) I moved to downtown Dallas with my mom about 3 years ago, which was a big change but we have adjusted pretty well. Currently I am in between jobs, but also learning how to silversmith and code.</p>

            <p id="p3">I have two cats (Houdini and Luna), no I am not crazy, and one dog (Lola). Lola, is dog aggressive and has gotten in fights before when we had other dogs. When we moved, Lola came with us and the other dog went with my dad. Lola now has her two best friends, the kitties, and enjoys living a lazy life. That is pretty much my life, it is not the most eventful but it keeps me busy enough.</p>
